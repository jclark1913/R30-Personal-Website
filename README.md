# R30-Personal-Website

---- Intro

This is a basic launch page/personal website made with html and css. There is an English and Arabic version included in the repo.

---- Known Issues / Future Changes

- Arabic localization is a bit unwieldly and would like to find a more robust solution in the future. Currently there is just a main folder then an /ar/ subfolder that houses the Arabic pages - it's probably fine when the website is so small but would like to explore better solutions.

- Current version is a bit bland.

- Some of the spacing is a bit goofy on the index page with the <hr> elements.

- Contact page could be replaced with a contact form and social media links moved to footer in future version.

- Page is responsive on desktop sizes (widescreen) but there is currently no mobile version.
